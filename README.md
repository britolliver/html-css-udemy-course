### This Course is ["Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/?referralCode=93317126211B2A500938) from Udemy.

I am trying to master CSS so I went through Udemy courses that I've purchased-but haven't started and/or completed-and chose this one. I am not sure if this will help with mastering css but I think it will help with the design aspect of Front End development.
